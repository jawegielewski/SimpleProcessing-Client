# SimpleProcessing-Client


This project was created as a part of greater project and to learn some technologies (Servlets, HTTP) by practice.

It allowed me to:

- learn how to deploy simple web server (Heroku cloud platform),
- learn how to connect client (Android) with server and do some processing by HTTP requests and responses,
- push forward my project of Android online game.
